# Static Thumbnail Maker

*thumbmaker.py* is a commandline tool which can download a website, find all `img` tags with images that are too big, and resize all the corresponding images so that they're correctly sized for the website.

*server.py* turns this in to a web app.

Everything is set up to run easily on dokku. A version can be found running on my own server at http://thumbnailer.apps.veryjoe.com
